This project's objective is to read the motion of lips and generate text from lip motion. This project is solely based on lip motion. I have implemented this project using two methods:
An overview you can find in 3rd_Sem_Presentation_Md_Laraib_Ahmad.pdf
More detail will be published further
Method 1:
Geometrically, The lip sequences are converted into text. The code is in project.ipynb file.  
This is my own research.
Method 2:
Sentence interpretation by lip movement
by using Deep Learning.
The code is in lip_reading_sentences.ipynb file.
