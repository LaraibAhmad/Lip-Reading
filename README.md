This project's objective is to read the motion of lips and generate text from lip motion. This project is solely based on lip motion; there is no feature extraction of audio. I have tried to implement this project using two methods:

Method 1:
Geometrically, I tried to convert lip sequences into text, details of which you will find in the documentation.

Method 2:
By using Deep Learning.

This project is a work in progress.
