This project's objective is to read the motion of lips and generate text from lip motion. This project is solely based on lip motion; there is no feature extraction of audio. I have implemented this project using two methods:
An overview you can find in 3rd_Sem_Presentation_Md_Laraib_Ahmad.pdf
More detail will be published further
Method 1:
Geometrically, The lip sequences are converted into text. The code is in project.ipynb file. 
Method 2:
By using Deep Learning.
By Deep Learning is under progess...
This project App for Lip Reading is also under progress...
